Spen the Sunday evening in a great way -- speaking (and listening) at [TEDx Viggbyholm](http://www.tedxviggbyholm.com/) in Stockholm. I held a relatively short session on natural beauty, taking the opportunity to speak about something else that "design". Here are my slides:

You can also <a href="http://hunch.se/stuff/patterns-of-beauty/patterns-of-beauty-by-rasmus-andersson-tedx.pdf">grab the PDF version</a> if you like.

These slides where just my visual aid. The actual talk will eventually be available at the [TEDx YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDxTalks).
